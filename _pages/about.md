A PhD student in statistical signal processing applied to radio astronomy, working under the supervision of [Pascal Larzabal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=aNwgKEEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Mohammed Nabil El Korso](https://sites.google.com/site/nabkorso/home-page) and [Lucien Bacharach](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=3eGVmwcAAAAJ&hl=fr) within the Signal Processing Group (MOSS) at the [SATIE](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) (Laboratoire des systèmes et applications des technologies de l'information et de l'énergie) laboratory of [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

My PhD thesis, titled **"Advanced Strategies for Interferometric Imaging with Switched Antennas"** focuses on developing innovative techniques in radio astronomical imaging and interference mitigation. My research topics include **radioastromical imaging**, **interference**, **Expectation-Maximization algorithm**, **antenna selection**, **model-based learning**. 

I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2018. In 2021, I completed my Master's degree under the supervision of [HAN Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gx0l_7cAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=12836345755951684912&oi=sra), majoring in Automation and Reinforcement Learning. My research focused on the cooperative control of multi-agent systems, formation tracking for multi-UAV systems, and applications of reinforcement learning. For further details on my work from this period, please visit my [Master’s research homepage.](https://jianhua-wang-buaa.github.io/).
